<h1>Custom Product Attribute Export for Magento 2</h1>

<b>Magento 2 Custom Product Attribute Export extension</b> provided by BSSCommerce helps customize report when export product attributes. In Magento 2 default, admin can only export all attributes of product in one collumn named “additional_attributes”. These attributes seperated by a comma (;) so, it seems hard to use and reading is not easy. This extension will solve this problem.

Custom Product Attribute Export for Magento 2 has key feature which shows product attributes in seperated collumn, dealing with cons of Magento default. In addition, it supports choosing needed attributes admin wants to export. This feature helps more convenient in processing data. One more point is, Magento 2 Custom Product Attribute Export extension will auto-update in config when new attributes added.

By special functions, Custom Product Attribute Export can help improve product management for Magento 2 store and save time from editing attributes of product.
